You’re absolutely right — the CrowdStrike Customer ID (CID) is a crucial part of installing the CrowdStrike agent, as it associates the agent with your organization’s CrowdStrike tenant. Here’s an updated script that includes the CID for Linux systems.

Explanation of Key Lines

    CID Configuration:
        The following line is used to associate the agent with your CrowdStrike organization:

    /opt/CrowdStrike/falconctl -s --cid=<YourCID>

    Replace <YourCID> with your actual CrowdStrike Customer ID. Your IT or security team should provide this.

Starting and Enabling the Service:

    Once the agent is installed, the falcon-sensor service must be started and enabled to ensure it runs on boot:

        systemctl start falcon-sensor
        systemctl enable falcon-sensor

    Temporary Directory:
        The installer is downloaded to /tmp/crowdstrike and cleaned up after installation to keep the instance tidy.

Steps to Deploy with AWS SSM

    Upload the .deb Package to S3:
        Store the .deb file securely in a private S3 bucket.

    Attach the IAM Role to the Instance:
        Ensure the IAM role attached to the EC2 instance has s3:GetObject permissions for the bucket.

    Run the Command:
        Use the AWS Systems Manager > Run Command console.
        Select the document AWS-RunShellScript.
        Paste the updated script into the command parameters section.

For RPM-Based Systems

If you're using an RPM-based system (e.g., Amazon Linux, Red Hat, CentOS), replace the .deb file with the .rpm package and use yum install:
