Part 1: Resiliency Checklists
1. Standalone EC2 Instances
For standalone servers, the focus is on configuring alarms, monitoring, recovery mechanisms, and manual failover processes. Here's a checklist for resiliency:

Monitoring and Alerting:

Enable CloudWatch Alarms for critical metrics like StatusCheckFailed, CPUUtilization, DiskWriteOps, and NetworkIn/Out.
Use CloudTrail to log API actions related to the instance (e.g., StopInstances, TerminateInstances).
Configure SNS notifications for triggered alarms.
Recovery:

Enable Auto-Recovery for system-level failures.
Create EBS snapshots or automate backups using AWS Backup with daily schedules.
Security and Compliance:

Ensure the SSM Agent is installed and running for remote management.
Use AWS Config to enforce security rules (e.g., instance type policies, restricted ports).
Incident Response:

Integrate SSM Incident Manager to create runbooks for tasks like restarting services or isolating compromised instances.
Ensure appropriate tagging for easy instance identification (e.g., Environment, Application).
2. Instances in Auto Scaling Groups with ELB
For auto-scaling groups, the focus shifts toward ensuring high availability, fault tolerance, and automated scaling.

Monitoring and Alerting:

Enable CloudWatch Alarms for metrics like target group health checks (HealthyHostCount) and scaling events (CPUUtilization).
Use CloudTrail to log API actions related to scaling events and instance terminations.
Configure ELB logs and Access Logs for HTTP/HTTPS health checks.
Recovery:

Ensure the Auto Scaling Group has health checks for instances and ELB target groups.
Use EFS or FSx for shared storage to preserve data across scaled instances.
Create AMIs for application images to standardize instance launches.
Security and Compliance:

Attach IAM roles to instances to allow only necessary permissions (e.g., S3 read/write for logs).
Use AWS WAF with ELB to protect against web-based attacks.
Incident Response:

Integrate SSM Automation to trigger workflows for recovering from unhealthy instances.
Use EventBridge to trigger incident workflows based on alarms or scaling events.
3. Unified Template with Input-Based Configuration
If desired, a single configuration template can be designed with input tags to handle both standalone instances and auto-scaling groups.

Input Tags:

InstanceType=Standalone or InstanceType=AutoScaling.
Environment=Prod, Environment=Dev, etc.
Logic:

Use a common automation script or tool (e.g., Terraform or CloudFormation) that detects the tag and applies configurations accordingly:
If InstanceType=Standalone: Apply standalone-specific configurations.
If InstanceType=AutoScaling: Apply ASG and ELB configurations.
Part 2: Creating JIRA Tickets for Implementation
JIRA Tickets for Standalone EC2 Instances
Ticket 1: Configure Monitoring and Alerting

Summary: Set up CloudWatch Alarms and CloudTrail for standalone EC2 instances.
Details:
Create alarms for StatusCheckFailed and critical metrics like CPU and disk usage.
Enable CloudTrail for logging instance-level API calls.
Integrate with SNS for notifications.
Reason: Monitoring is critical for detecting and responding to instance-level issues proactively.

Ticket 2: Automate Backup and Recovery

Summary: Implement EBS snapshots and enable Auto-Recovery.
Details:
Schedule daily EBS snapshots using Data Lifecycle Manager.
Configure auto-recovery for system failures via CloudWatch.
Reason: Ensures data durability and automated recovery during system-level issues.

Ticket 3: Configure Security and Incident Response

Summary: Set up SSM Agent and incident response workflows.
Details:
Ensure SSM Agent is installed and running on all instances.
Configure runbooks for incident response (e.g., restart services, isolation).
Apply appropriate IAM roles for least privilege.
Reason: Enables secure remote management and standardized incident handling.

JIRA Tickets for Auto Scaling Groups with ELB
Ticket 1: Set Up Monitoring for ASG and ELB

Summary: Configure CloudWatch Alarms and ELB logs for the ASG.
Details:
Enable alarms for scaling events and ELB health checks.
Configure ELB access logs for request monitoring.
Reason: Provides visibility into scaling and load balancer operations.

Ticket 2: Automate Scaling and Recovery

Summary: Configure health checks and shared storage for ASG instances.
Details:
Ensure ELB and instance health checks are enabled.
Use EFS or FSx for shared storage across scaled instances.
Reason: Prevents downtime and ensures seamless recovery during scaling events.

Ticket 3: Harden Security for Auto-Scaled Instances

Summary: Apply IAM roles and WAF protection.
Details:
Attach roles to instances for limited access to AWS services.
Configure WAF for the ELB to protect against malicious traffic.
Reason: Ensures secure operation of auto-scaled workloads and protects against web-based attacks.

Why Each Ticket is 3-5 Points
Complexity:

Each ticket focuses on a single area (e.g., monitoring, recovery, security) to avoid overwhelming scope.
Tickets are designed to be modular, enabling different team members to work on them simultaneously.
Time Estimate:

Each task (e.g., setting up alarms, enabling backups) typically takes 2-4 hours, depending on the environment complexity.
Combined, tickets can be completed within a sprint.
Independent Value:

Each ticket delivers measurable value independently (e.g., alarms provide visibility, backups ensure durability).
