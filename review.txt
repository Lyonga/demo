The EC2 hardening repo is exciting to see. A few next steps to fully operationalize this comes to mind:
1.	In order to take full advantage of this pattern having some consumer documentation and marketing of this is important.
2.	As a part of that consumer flow I’d suggest considering either making this repo a template repo or structuring it as a centrally maintained module (cosmos module) that can be inherited by other terraform repos (I can provide examples and more detail on either option)
3.	As an accompanying factor to the template I’d suggest considering what guardrails (SCP’s, RCP’s, etc) should be put in place for various aspects of the hardening to prevent variance from the standard and further increase the value of the template. This is the most common strategy I have seen effectively used for shifting work to the app owning teams as a part of the devops model. Given them a template to make it easy and implement guardrails to still support edge cases while minimizing them.
