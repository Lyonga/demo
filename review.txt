Below is a **practical guide** on how to **resolve all the redundancies** in your script and address specific points:

---

## 1) Dealing With Multiple `get_tagged_cost_data` Definitions

Your script currently shows **two versions** of `get_tagged_cost_data`:

- **Version A** (with a parameter `get_tagged_cost_data(account_numbers, custom_filter)`).
- **Version B** (without the `account_numbers` parameter).

Often, only **one** version is needed:  
- **Option 1**: If you are already specifying which accounts to filter in the `custom_filter` (i.e., the filter itself includes the `LINKED_ACCOUNT` dimension), then you can drop the `account_numbers` argument.  
- **Option 2**: If you want to pass `account_numbers` separately, you can incorporate them into the final filter inside the function.

### **Resolution**:
1. **Keep** whichever definition **best matches your usage**. 
2. **Remove** or **comment out** the other one. 
3. If you need both approaches, rename them more clearly to avoid confusion, e.g.:
   - `get_tagged_cost_data_with_accounts(custom_filter, account_numbers)`
   - `get_tagged_cost_data_no_accounts(custom_filter)`

From the **main function** (`lambda_handler`) perspective, if you’re calling:

```python
route_filter = build_ce_filter_for_route(route, account_numbers)
route_data   = get_tagged_cost_data(route_filter)  # Filter includes accounts
```

Then your `custom_filter` **already** has `account_numbers` inside it. Hence, **you do NOT** need a separate `account_numbers` parameter. So you can **use Version B only**, which is simpler:

```python
def get_tagged_cost_data(custom_filter):
    ...
```

This keeps things consistent.

## 2) Determining if the Main Function Uses `get_tagged_cost_data` With Account Numbers

By default, your **`lambda_handler`** code calls:

```python
route_filter = build_ce_filter_for_route(route, account_numbers)
route_data   = get_tagged_cost_data(route_filter)
```

- Here, `get_tagged_cost_data(...)` accepts a single argument (the `route_filter`).  
- The “account_numbers” have already been embedded into that filter thanks to `build_ce_filter_for_route(route, account_numbers)`.

**Answer**:  
- The main function **does NOT** directly pass `account_numbers` as a separate argument to `get_tagged_cost_data`. It uses the filter that **already** includes the account dimension.  
- Therefore, you only need a single version of the function: `get_tagged_cost_data(custom_filter)` with no separate `account_numbers` parameter.

## 3) How to Use `get_linked_accounts` in the Main Flow

Your script defines:

```python
def get_linked_accounts(account_list):
    # returns a list of defined accounts that are also "active" in the given date range
```

**But** the main function never calls it. Instead, you hardcode:

```python
account_numbers = list(accountDict.keys())
```

**To leverage `get_linked_accounts`,** you can replace that line with something like:

```python
# Instead of listing keys directly:
candidate_accounts = list(accountDict.keys())
# Now call get_linked_accounts to ensure they are actually active in the cost data
account_numbers = get_linked_accounts(candidate_accounts)
```

You then proceed using `account_numbers` in the rest of the code. This ensures that if, for example, one of the accounts is not active or has no cost data, it won’t be included in subsequent calls.

### Example snippet:

```python
# (B) Overall lumpsum by (account, service)
candidate_accounts = list(accountDict.keys())
account_numbers    = get_linked_accounts(candidate_accounts)  # filter by active

overall_data = get_cost_data(account_numbers)
display_overall = restructure_cost_data(overall_data, account_numbers)
```

This way, you actually use the `get_linked_accounts` function **as intended**.

## 4) Setting an Exact Monthly Window

Right now, the logic for `start_date` and `end_date` is:

```python
MONTHSBACK = 2
today = datetime.now()
first_of_this_month = today.replace(day=1)

start_date = (first_of_this_month - timedelta(days=MONTHSBACK * 30)).replace(day=1)
end_date = first_of_this_month
```

This can be **inexact** due to 28, 29, 30, or 31 days in a month. A more **robust** approach is to use a library like `dateutil`’s `relativedelta`, or you can simply do:

```python
from datetime import datetime
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta

today = datetime.now()
first_of_this_month = today.replace(day=1)

# Subtract exactly 2 calendar months:
start_date = first_of_this_month - relativedelta(months=MONTHSBACK)
end_date   = first_of_this_month
```

Then your final strings:

```python
MONTHLY_START_DATE = start_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
MONTHLY_END_DATE   = end_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
```

This ensures:
- **start_date** is the first day of **exactly 2 months** prior,
- **end_date** is the first day of the **current month**, 
- No confusion around 28 vs. 30 vs. 31 days.

You can also decide if you want `end_date` to be **exclusive** or **inclusive**. AWS Cost Explorer typically expects the **End** in its queries to be exclusive, i.e. “up to but not including end_date”. So if you want January’s full cost, you do:

- `Start = "2023-01-01"`
- `End   = "2023-02-01"`  (so cost data up to Jan 31 is included)

If you want the month **inclusively**, you might do `end_date = first_of_this_month + relativedelta(days=-1)` or similar. But typically for monthly cost reporting, the `start_date` of each month and the next month’s first day as `end_date` is a common approach.

## Summary of Changes to Resolve Redundancies

1. **Keep a single `get_tagged_cost_data(custom_filter)`** definition.  
   - Remove or ignore the second version that takes both `(account_numbers, custom_filter)`.
   - Confirm that your `build_ce_filter_for_route` includes the account dimension so you don’t need to separately pass `account_numbers`.

2. **Actually use `get_linked_accounts`** if you want to confirm which accounts are active.  
   - Replace `account_numbers = list(accountDict.keys())` with:
     ```python
     candidate_accounts = list(accountDict.keys())
     account_numbers = get_linked_accounts(candidate_accounts)
     ```
   - This ensures you only operate on accounts that truly appear in the Cost Explorer dimension values.

3. **Use `relativedelta`** (from `dateutil`) to set an **exact window**:
   ```python
   from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta

   MONTHSBACK = 2
   today = datetime.now()
   first_of_this_month = today.replace(day=1)
   start_date = first_of_this_month - relativedelta(months=MONTHSBACK)
   end_date   = first_of_this_month
   ```

With these changes:
- You remove duplicate code.
- You handle the monthly window precisely (not influenced by 28/29/30/31 days).
- You can dynamically detect active accounts.

This aligns your code more cleanly, ensuring **no** unused or conflicting functions remain, and producing consistent **monthly** cost data.
