As a senior cloud engineer, I was asked by my engineering manager to review and find out the cause of excessive
cost increase on AWS. I did and presented and had two follow up ask:

1. Propose a process that can be automated to help team product owners to make cost concious decisions on current vs
past cost consumptions and give decision points with possible suggestions on how to reduce/save cost.(suggest 3 to 5 options if possible)

2. Identify spending incosistencies for s3 outside of organic cost increase and suggest possible data retention policies in an effort to reduce s3 cost



Below is a structured approach to address both of your manager’s follow-up asks. These suggestions assume use of AWS-native tooling (such as AWS Budgets, AWS Cost Explorer, CloudWatch, and AWS S3 Lifecycle policies), but the framework can be adapted to any third-party cost-management tools as well.

1. Automated Process for Cost-Conscious Decisions
Goals
Provide product owners with meaningful cost insights based on current vs. historical usage.
Surface decision points and actionable recommendations to reduce costs.
Integrate seamlessly into existing development or sprint cycles.
High-Level Overview of the Proposed Process
Data Collection and Analysis: Gather AWS cost and usage data (daily/weekly) across services.
Automated Insights Generation: Compare against baselines or budgets and detect anomalies.
Reporting & Recommendations: Present cost trends, highlight potential optimizations, and propose next steps.
Action & Follow-Up: Automated or manual triggers (e.g., Slack notifications, Jira tickets) to ensure cost-saving actions are tracked and completed.
Key Tools & Services
AWS Budgets: Set up budgets and track actual vs. forecasted spend.
AWS Cost Explorer: Visualize historical trends and get cost anomaly detection.
AWS Billing & Cost Management API: Programmatically retrieve cost data to feed your automation pipelines.
AWS CloudWatch: Create metrics and alarms based on custom thresholds for cost or usage.
Jira/Ticketing Integration (or similar) for follow-up on recommended actions.
Possible Options/Flows (3-5)
Option A: Budget Threshold with Automated Notifications
Create Budget Thresholds in AWS Budgets for each product/team.
Set Up Alerts: If a monthly cost threshold (e.g., 80% of budget) is reached, an alert is sent to a Slack channel or email.
Automated Trend Analysis: Leverage AWS Cost Explorer’s “Anomaly Detection” to understand if usage spikes are out of the ordinary.
Recommendation Engine: A small Lambda function can parse these anomalies and provide suggestions (e.g., “Underutilized EC2 instances found, consider downsizing or shutting down.”).
Option B: Cost Dashboard with Weekly Snapshots
Daily Data Pipeline: Use AWS Cost & Usage Report (CUR) to feed a data store (e.g., S3 -> Athena -> QuickSight).
Weekly Snapshot Reports: Generate QuickSight dashboards with weekly cost deltas vs. previous periods.
Team-Specific Metrics: Include at-a-glance metrics (e.g., cost per service, cost per environment).
Automated Recommendations: Integrate AWS Trusted Advisor or custom logic to highlight potential cost-optimization opportunities (e.g., “EBS volumes unattached for 30 days.”).
Option C: Jira Workflow Integration
Scheduled Job (e.g., weekly Lambda) queries AWS Cost Explorer for cost anomalies or usage spikes.
Auto-Creation of Jira Tickets: When an anomaly is found or budget is exceeded, a new ticket is automatically created in the relevant team’s backlog with details on the cost spike.
Proposed Solutions in the Ticket: e.g., “Delete old AMIs,” “Optimize RDS instance size,” “Migrate to spot instances,” “Review S3 lifecycle settings.”
Acceptance Criteria: Ticket must be resolved with an action or justification (e.g., “The spike is valid for our marketing event”).
Option D: Preventative Guardrails (Infrastructure as Code)
Policy as Code: Use AWS Organizations Service Control Policies (SCP) or Config Rules to ensure certain cost-heavy actions are flagged or restricted.
IAM Governance: Limit who can create large EC2 instances or expensive resources.
Automated Pull Request Checks: If using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/CloudFormation), implement checks that estimate cost prior to merge.
Alerts on Large Resource Changes: E.g., a Slack notification if someone spins up an r5.24xlarge EC2 instance.
Option E: Continuous Feedback in CI/CD
Cost Estimation Tool: Integrate open-source cost estimation or AWS Price List API into the build pipeline.
Cost Gate: If the proposed changes will significantly increase monthly spend, block or require manual approval of the PR.
In-PR Recommendations: “By switching from on-demand to spot instances, you could save 70% on cost.”
2. Identifying S3 Spending Inconsistencies & Data Retention Policies
Background
S3 costs can spike due to unanticipated data growth, inefficient retention policies, or untracked usage (e.g., logging buckets).
Organic cost increases are expected as data grows with product usage, but inconsistent or spurious spikes often point to misconfigurations, leftover test data, or inefficient storage classes.
Steps to Identify Spending Inconsistencies
Analyze Past Usage: Use AWS Cost Explorer or the S3 Storage Lens to see daily/weekly cost trends over time.
Compare Buckets & Storage Classes: Check for unexpected transitions to more expensive storage classes (e.g., if data is suddenly in standard storage vs. infrequent access).
Look for Large Increases in Data Transfer: Data transfer costs can rise if objects are frequently accessed or moved across regions.
Check Lifecycle Policies: Ensure they are still valid and performing as expected, and that data that should be archived is not stuck in Standard storage.
Suggested Data Retention Policies/Actions
Lifecycle Tiering Policy

Hot Data: Frequently accessed data remains in S3 Standard or S3 Standard-IA for a short initial period.
Cold Data: Automatically transition objects to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval or S3 Glacier Deep Archive after a defined period (e.g., 90 days).
Expiration Policy: For data that is no longer needed, expire or delete after compliance requirements are met.
Split Buckets by Data Access Patterns

Separate your buckets into “frequently accessed” vs. “rarely accessed” so you can easily apply different lifecycle rules without conflict.
Ensure proper tagging of buckets and objects to track ownership and chargeback.
Versioning Clean-Up

If versioning is enabled but not managed properly, old versions of objects can accumulate and drive up storage costs.
Implement a lifecycle rule to expire non-current versions after X days.
Archive Stale Logs

Application logs or CloudTrail logs in S3 can accumulate quickly.
Transition them to S3 Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive if they are only needed for compliance or troubleshooting after a certain period.
Regular Housekeeping

Quarterly Review: Schedule a quarterly cost review to verify that buckets still align with the defined retention policy.
Automated Checks: A simple Lambda function can run monthly to identify any bucket with large unexpected growth and notify relevant teams.
Putting It All Together
By combining the automated process (Part 1) with robust S3-specific policies (Part 2), teams gain:

Visibility: Clear line of sight into costs, anomalies, and potential savings.
Actionability: Automated alerts and integrated recommendations help teams quickly address cost issues before they become unmanageable.
Governance: Data retention policies and lifecycle rules ensure S3 storage stays under control, preserving only the necessary data for the required duration.
These suggestions should help product owners make more informed, cost-conscious decisions and ensure that your organization’s AWS environment remains optimized and aligned with budgetary expectations.
