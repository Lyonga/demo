1. EC2 Instance Actions
SSM documents can manage, troubleshoot, and configure EC2 instances.

Instance Management
Start, Stop, Reboot, or Terminate Instances:
Automate instance lifecycle management tasks.
Example: Use the AWS-StartEC2Instance, AWS-StopEC2Instance, AWS-RebootEC2Instance, or AWS-TerminateEC2Instance documents.
Resize an Instance:
Change the instance type to handle workloads better. Example: Use a custom document to stop the instance, modify its type, and restart it.
Create or Restore from an AMI:
Automate AMI creation for backup or recovery.
Instance Configuration
Install or Update Software:
Install critical software (e.g., security agents, application dependencies) or apply patches using AWS-RunShellScript or AWS-RunPowerShellScript.
Apply Security Updates:
Automate patching using AWS-RunPatchBaseline to install the latest OS patches or software updates.
Configure System Settings:
Modify OS or application settings, such as DNS configuration, network settings, or application log levels.
Troubleshooting
Retrieve Logs or System Metrics:
Automate log collection for analysis (e.g., /var/log/syslog, application logs).
Collect metrics (e.g., CPU, memory usage) for troubleshooting.
Diagnose and Resolve Issues:
Automate workflows for common issues like high CPU usage or disk space problems using custom SSM documents.
Security and Compliance
Isolate Compromised Instances:
Modify security groups or network ACLs to restrict instance communication.
Rotate IAM Credentials or SSH Keys:
Update or revoke instance access credentials.
2. EBS Volume Actions
SSM documents can manage EBS volumes attached to EC2 instances or independently.

Volume Management
Attach or Detach Volumes:
Use automation to attach or detach volumes dynamically during operations or recovery.
Modify Volume Size or Type:
Increase volume size or change the volume type (e.g., from gp2 to gp3) to improve performance or handle more data.
Example: Use AWS-ModifyVolume.
Automate Snapshot Management:
Create snapshots for backup purposes or restore volumes from snapshots.
Example: Use AWS-CreateSnapshot or AWS-RestoreVolumeFromSnapshot.
Performance and Optimization
Optimize Disk Performance:
Resize, reattach, or migrate volumes for better throughput or IOPS.
Monitor and Diagnose Volume Issues:
Collect metrics like volume queue length, IOPS, or throughput for diagnostic purposes.
3. AWS Service Actions
SSM documents are not limited to EC2 and EBS; they can also orchestrate tasks across other AWS services.

Networking and VPC
Update Security Groups:
Modify or replace security group rules for EC2 instances.
Manage Route Tables:
Update or troubleshoot route table configurations.
Isolate Resources:
Reconfigure network ACLs to quarantine resources.
S3 Operations
Manage Buckets and Objects:
Automate tasks like creating, deleting, or copying S3 objects or buckets.
Enable Logging or Versioning:
Update S3 bucket settings for security or compliance.
RDS Management
Backup Databases:
Trigger automated database snapshots for RDS.
Resize or Modify Instances:
Change instance classes or apply configuration updates.
Restore from Backups:
Use SSM workflows to restore databases from snapshots or automated backups.
CloudFormation
Deploy or Update Stacks:
Automate the deployment or update of CloudFormation stacks.
Roll Back Stacks:
Trigger rollback workflows in case of deployment failures.
Lambda Management
Update Lambda Code:
Automate the deployment of new Lambda versions or configurations.
Invoke Lambda Functions:
Use Lambda for specific tasks like data processing or triggering alerts.
4. Custom Automation Workflows
You can create custom SSM documents for complex workflows involving multiple AWS resources.

Disaster Recovery
Automate Failover:
Create workflows to launch backup instances in another region or Availability Zone (AZ).
Restore Resources:
Automate restoration of EC2 instances, EBS volumes, or RDS databases.
Incident Response
Security Event Automation:
Automatically isolate compromised resources (e.g., EC2, RDS) and notify the security team.
Example: Trigger workflows based on GuardDuty or Security Hub findings using EventBridge and SSM.
Application-Level Actions
Deploy Applications:
Install or update applications on EC2 instances.
Scale Applications:
Add instances to an Auto Scaling group or scale databases dynamically based on traffic patterns.
5. Multi-Service Orchestration
SSM documents can integrate actions across services, enabling powerful workflows.

Example Multi-Service Automation
Patch and Snapshot Workflow:
Automatically apply patches to an EC2 instance, create a snapshot of the associated EBS volume, and log the operation in CloudWatch Logs.
Security Remediation Workflow:
Detect a misconfigured security group (via AWS Config), trigger SSM to fix the configuration, and notify the operations team via SNS.
6. Examples of AWS-Provided SSM Documents
Here are some common AWS-managed SSM documents you can use:

SSM Document	Description
AWS-RunShellScript	Run shell commands on Linux instances.
AWS-RunPowerShellScript	Run PowerShell commands on Windows instances.
AWS-RunPatchBaseline	Apply OS patches to instances.
AWS-ApplyAnsiblePlaybooks	Apply Ansible playbooks to instances.
AWS-CreateSnapshot	Create EBS volume snapshots.
AWS-RestoreVolumeFromSnapshot	Restore an EBS volume from a snapshot.
AWS-StartEC2Instance	Start an EC2 instance.
AWS-StopEC2Instance	Stop an EC2 instance.
AWS-RebootEC2Instance	Reboot an EC2 instance.
AWS-TerminateEC2Instance	Terminate an EC2 instance.
AWS-ConfigureAWSPackage	Install or configure AWS software packages.
AWS-UpdateCloudFormationStack	Update a CloudFormation stack.
Summary
SSM documents are a versatile tool for automating actions on EC2 instances, EBS volumes, and other AWS services. These documents enable you to manage infrastructure, optimize performance, enhance security, and orchestrate multi-service workflows efficiently. Whether it's installing software, patching instances, automating backups, or remediating security findings, SSM provides the foundation for streamlined and scalable management across your AWS environment.
