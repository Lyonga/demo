7. Cost Visibility & Monitoring
Key Aspects:
Budgets & Alerts: Set budget thresholds and receive notifications when costs exceed predefined limits.
Cost Explorer: Analyze historical spending patterns and create custom reports.
Trusted Advisor: Use AWS Trusted Advisor to get automated best practice recommendations on cost optimization.
AWS Cost Anomaly Detection: Detect unusual spikes in spending.
Automated Implementation:
Create Budgets with AWS Budgets:

Use AWS Budgets to create monthly, quarterly, or yearly budgets.
Configure notifications when a budget exceeds thresholds using Amazon SNS.
Automate setup using AWS Budgets CLI or AWS SDKs.
Enable Cost Explorer Reports:

Enable Cost Explorer in the Management Console.
Use Cost Explorer APIs to create reports and integrate them with dashboards like Amazon QuickSight.
Use Trusted Advisor Automation:

Enable Trusted Advisor for automatic checks on unused resources.
Automate checks using AWS Lambda functions triggered by AWS Config rules.
Cost Anomaly Detection:

Create anomaly detection monitors using AWS Cost Anomaly Detection.
Define anomaly detection models and set up alerting via Amazon SNS.
8. Tagging & Resource Organization
Key Aspects:
Tagging Strategy: Define a consistent resource tagging policy (e.g., Environment, Project, Owner, CostCenter).
Cost Allocation Tags: Enable cost allocation tags in the AWS Billing and Cost Management console.
Automated Implementation:
Tag Enforcement Using AWS Config:

Create AWS Config rules such as required-tags to enforce specific tags on all AWS resources.
Set remediation actions using AWS Systems Manager Automation.
Auto-Tagging with Lambda:

Deploy an AWS Lambda function triggered by CloudTrail events to auto-tag new resources.
Example: Auto-apply Owner, Environment, or Project tags based on context.
Tag Compliance Reporting:

Use AWS Resource Groups Tag Editor to generate compliance reports.
Automate compliance checks with AWS Config and Lambda.
Automated Cleanup with Tag-Based Policies:

Set policies in AWS Service Catalog or use AWS Organizations Service Control Policies (SCPs) to enforce tagging at the account level.
Create lifecycle policies in S3 based on tags for automated data management.
Custom Resource Management Scripts:

Use Terraform or CloudFormation to enforce tagging policies during resource creation.
Include tagging rules in CI/CD pipelines for infrastructure as code.
