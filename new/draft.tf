######################
Throughput Calculation in FSx and Cost Optimization Approach
Understanding FSx Throughput Costs

Amazon FSx charges for provisioned throughput capacity, meaning you pay for the allocated capacity, not the actual usage.

In the screenshot, the FSx provisioned throughput is 2,048 MiBps-Mo, and the charge is $2.20 per MBps-Mo, resulting in:
2,048Ã—2.20=4,505.60 USD/month
2,048Ã—2.20=4,505.60 USD/month

However, CloudWatch metrics show that only 3.69% of the throughput is being used, meaning the allocated throughput is significantly over-provisioned.
Example Calculation for Right-Sizing Throughput

If actual used throughput is 3.69% of 2,048 MiBps:
2,048Ã—0.0369=75.65 MiBps
2,048Ã—0.0369=75.65 MiBps

To reduce costs, we should provision throughput closer to actual usage, with a small buffer (e.g., 100 MiBps instead of 2,048 MiBps).

If we reduce provisioned throughput to 100 MiBps, the new cost would be:
100Ã—2.20=220 USD/month
100Ã—2.20=220 USD/month

This change would result in monthly savings of:
4,505.60âˆ’220=4,285.60 USD/month
4,505.60âˆ’220=4,285.60 USD/month
What is an Acceptable Throughput to Start With?

    Baseline Recommendation:
        If FSx usage is low, start with 64â€“128 MiBps for moderate workloads.
        For heavier workloads, 256â€“512 MiBps might be required.

    How to Scale Throughput Dynamically?
        Use Amazon CloudWatch to track actual usage over time.
        Set up AWS Auto Scaling to adjust throughput dynamically.
        Use AWS FSx API or CLI to manually scale throughput.

Does Scaling Throughput Affect Stored Files?

    NO impact on stored files. FSx dynamically scales throughput without data loss.
    Performance Impact: Reducing throughput too much may affect access speed for high-load workloads.

Other CloudWatch Metrics That Can Help with Cost Optimization

From the screenshots, we can use these CloudWatch metrics to further optimize costs:
Metric Name	How It Helps Optimize Costs
StorageCapacityUtilization	If utilization is low, we can reduce allocated storage.
DeduplicationSavedStorage	Measures how much space deduplication saves.
FileServerDiskThroughputUtilization	Helps identify over-provisioned throughput.
DiskReadBytes / DiskWriteBytes	Identifies if storage is underutilized.
MemoryUtilization	Helps determine if workload needs higher performance settings.
ClientConnections	Shows how many active connections FSx is serving. If low, we may be over-provisioned.
Example Cost-Saving Decisions Using These Metrics

    StorageCapacityUtilization < 50%? Reduce storage allocation to save costs.
    FileServerDiskThroughputUtilization < 5%? Reduce throughput to save on throughput charges.
    DeduplicationSavedStorage < 30%? Enable deduplication for additional storage efficiency.

Final Recommendations

    Reduce FSx throughput to 100â€“150 MiBps to match actual usage (~$4,285/month savings).
    Enable storage deduplication to reduce allocated storage (potential 50%+ storage savings).
    Monitor storage utilization and adjust storage allocation to prevent over-provisioning.
    Move older backup data to Amazon S3 Glacier to cut backup costs by up to 80%.

######################
Auto-Scaling Strategy for FSx Throughput and Storage Using CloudWatch Metrics

To dynamically scale FSx throughput and storage, we will use CloudWatch Alarms, AWS Lambda, and FSx API (or CLI/SDK) to adjust throughput and storage based on actual usage.
1. Auto-Scaling FSx Throughput

FSx allows manual throughput scaling, so we need a solution that:

    Monitors actual throughput utilization (CloudWatch metric: FileServerDiskThroughputUtilization).
    Triggers an adjustment when utilization is too high or too low.
    Invokes AWS Lambda to scale throughput up or down.

A. Steps for Implementing FSx Throughput Auto-Scaling

    Define CloudWatch Alarms for Throughput
        Scale Down (Over-Provisioned): If utilization < 10% for 24 hours, reduce throughput.
        Scale Up (Under-Provisioned): If utilization > 80% for 15 minutes, increase throughput.

    Create an AWS Lambda Function to Adjust Throughput
        The function will retrieve current FSx throughput.
        If an alarm is triggered, it will update the FSx throughput to a new value.
        The Lambda function needs AWS FSx API permissions to modify throughput.

    Attach CloudWatch Alarm to Lambda
        When an alarm threshold is met, it triggers the Lambda function.

B. Example Terraform Code for Throughput Auto-Scaling

resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "fsx_scale_down" {
  alarm_name          = "FSx-Scale-Down"
  comparison_operator = "LessThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = 1
  metric_name         = "FileServerDiskThroughputUtilization"
  namespace          = "AWS/FSx"
  period             = 86400  # 24 hours
  statistic         = "Average"
  threshold         = 10
  alarm_actions      = [aws_lambda_function.fsx_scale_throughput.arn]
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "fsx_scale_up" {
  alarm_name          = "FSx-Scale-Up"
  comparison_operator = "GreaterThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = 1
  metric_name         = "FileServerDiskThroughputUtilization"
  namespace          = "AWS/FSx"
  period             = 900  # 15 minutes
  statistic         = "Average"
  threshold         = 80
  alarm_actions      = [aws_lambda_function.fsx_scale_throughput.arn]
}

C. AWS Lambda Function for Throughput Adjustment (Python)

This function checks FSx throughput usage and scales accordingly.

import boto3

FSX_ID = "fs-xxxxxxxxxx"
MIN_THROUGHPUT = 64   # MiBps
MAX_THROUGHPUT = 512  # MiBps
THROUGHPUT_STEP = 64  # Adjust in increments

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    client = boto3.client("fsx")

    # Get current FSx file system details
    response = client.describe_file_systems(FileSystemIds=[FSX_ID])
    current_throughput = response['FileSystems'][0]['ThroughputCapacity']

    # Determine scale-up or scale-down based on CloudWatch Alarm trigger
    if "FSx-Scale-Down" in event['AlarmName']:
        new_throughput = max(current_throughput - THROUGHPUT_STEP, MIN_THROUGHPUT)
    elif "FSx-Scale-Up" in event['AlarmName']:
        new_throughput = min(current_throughput + THROUGHPUT_STEP, MAX_THROUGHPUT)
    else:
        return {"message": "No scaling action taken"}

    # Update FSx throughput capacity
    client.update_file_system(
        FileSystemId=FSX_ID,
        ThroughputCapacity=new_throughput
    )

    return {"message": f"FSx Throughput updated to {new_throughput} MiBps"}

âœ… How it Works

    If under 10% utilization, it decreases throughput by 64 MiBps until reaching 64 MiBps minimum.
    If over 80% utilization, it increases throughput by 64 MiBps up to 512 MiBps max.

ðŸ”¹ Estimated Savings: This setup prevents wasted throughput capacity, which could cut costs by 80-90%.
2. Auto-Scaling FSx Storage

Unlike throughput, FSx storage scales automatically when needed, but we can:

    Identify underutilized storage (metric: StorageCapacityUtilization).
    Optimize storage through deduplication (metric: DeduplicationSavedStorage).
    Trigger lifecycle policies for old data (metric: DiskReadOperations).

A. CloudWatch Alarms for Storage Optimization

resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "fsx_dedupe_enable" {
  alarm_name          = "FSx-Enable-Deduplication"
  comparison_operator = "LessThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = 3
  metric_name         = "DeduplicationSavedStorage"
  namespace          = "AWS/FSx"
  period             = 86400
  statistic         = "Average"
  threshold         = 20  # If deduplication savings < 20%, alert for manual review
  alarm_actions      = [aws_sns_topic.fsx_dedupe_alert.arn]
}

B. Enable Data Deduplication Automatically

Data deduplication is a manual setting in FSx. We can automate enabling it via AWS CLI or API when needed.
AWS CLI Command

aws fsx update-file-system \
  --file-system-id fs-xxxxxxxxxx \
  --windows-configuration \
  "AutomaticBackupRetentionDays=7,DailyAutomaticBackupStartTime=03:00,DeduplicationConfiguration={DeduplicationEnabled=true}"

âœ… How it Helps

    Cuts storage costs by up to 50-80%.
    No impact on performance.
    Reduces unnecessary storage overhead.

3. Backup Optimization

To reduce backup costs, we can:

    Move older backups to S3 Glacier (80-90% cheaper).
    Delete unnecessary backups automatically.

A. AWS Backup Plan for FSx

We define a backup lifecycle rule using AWS Backup:

resource "aws_backup_plan" "fsx_backup_plan" {
  name = "FSxBackupPlan"

  rule {
    rule_name         = "MoveToGlacier"
    target_vault_name = aws_backup_vault.fsx_backup_vault.name
    schedule          = "cron(0 3 * * ? *)"

    lifecycle {
      delete_after = 365  # Retain for 1 year
      move_to_cold_storage_after = 30  # Move to Glacier after 30 days
    }
  }
}

âœ… Expected Savings

    Moving 80% of backups to Glacier saves ~80% on backup storage.

Final Cost-Saving Summary
Optimization Action	Estimated Savings
Throughput Auto-Scaling (from 2,048 MiBps to 128 MiBps)	$4,285/month
Enable Deduplication	$8-12/month
Move Backups to Glacier	$0.30/month
Total Potential Savings	~$4,300/month (~81% reduction)
Conclusion

    Biggest savings come from reducing throughput to match actual usage.
    Deduplication and storage lifecycle policies provide additional cost cuts.
    All changes are automatic using AWS CloudWatch Alarms, Lambda, and Backup Plans.
