Yes. In a previous discussion, we pointed out that:

> **If** you do:
> ```python
> MONTHSBACK = 2
> start_date = (first_of_this_month - timedelta(days=MONTHSBACK * 30)).replace(day=1)
> end_date   = first_of_this_month
> ```
> you’re effectively approximating “two months back” by subtracting **30** days per month – but real months might have 28, 29, 30, or 31 days. Thus, you **could** end up with slight misalignment from actual monthly boundaries if the starting month was shorter or longer than 30 days.

Below is a **short recap** of that recommendation and **how** you might handle truly exact month boundaries.

---

## 1) The Issue with `MONTHSBACK * 30`

Let’s say `MONTHSBACK = 2` and you run the function on April 15. The code might do:

```python
today = datetime.now()           # e.g. 2025-04-15
first_of_this_month = today.replace(day=1)   # 2025-04-01

# Subtract (MONTHSBACK * 30) = 60 days:
start_date = (first_of_this_month - timedelta(days=60)).replace(day=1)
# if first_of_this_month was 2025-04-01, minus 60 days => approx early Feb,
# then we do .replace(day=1) => 2025-02-01

end_date = first_of_this_month   # 2025-04-01
```

- If the prior months had 31 days (say March had 31, February had 28 or 29), you might be off by a few days from exact monthly boundaries. You might land on `2025-02-01` to `2025-04-01`, which is basically 2 months. But if you do this in a month with 31 days, the math is an approximation.

## 2) Exact Month Boundaries Using Offsets

One fix is to do **true** monthly offsets. For example:

```python
import datetime

MONTHSBACK = 2
today = datetime.datetime.now()

# e.g. if it's currently 2025-04-15, first_of_this_month => 2025-04-01
first_of_this_month = today.replace(day=1)

# We want to go exactly 2 months earlier:
# e.g. if first_of_this_month=2025-04-01,
# then the start_date => 2025-02-01
# We can do a small helper function or just do “month math” with dateutil.

import dateutil.relativedelta

start_date_dt = first_of_this_month - dateutil.relativedelta.relativedelta(months=MONTHSBACK)
end_date_dt   = first_of_this_month

# Then we format them as YYYY-MM-DD
MONTHLY_START_DATE = start_date_dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
MONTHLY_END_DATE   = end_date_dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

print(MONTHLY_START_DATE, "to", MONTHLY_END_DATE)
# e.g. "2025-02-01 to 2025-04-01"
```

### Explanation

- We use **`relativedelta(months=MONTHSBACK)`** from the [**python-dateutil**](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/) library, which is typically available in AWS Lambda (or you can layer it).  
- Subtracting `months=2` from `2025-04-01` yields `2025-02-01`, ignoring the day-of-month differences in each month.  
- That’s exact monthly boundaries, so you’re guaranteed the result is a “clean” range for Cost Explorer.

## 3) If You Don’t Want dateutil

You can do a simpler pure-Python approach: If `first_of_this_month = 2025-04-01`, just subtract 2 from the month and fix up the year if the month goes below 1. For example:

```python
def get_month_boundary(MONTHSBACK):
    # current month boundary
    today = datetime.datetime.now()
    first_of_this_month = today.replace(day=1)

    y = first_of_this_month.year
    m = first_of_this_month.month - MONTHSBACK
    # fix negative months
    while m < 1:
        m += 12
        y -= 1

    start_date_dt = first_of_this_month.replace(year=y, month=m)

    return (
      start_date_dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
      first_of_this_month.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
    )
```

**Either** approach yields an exact “N months ago” boundary, which is typically what you want for a monthly cost range.

## 4) Final Summary

- **The recommendation** was to use an **exact** monthly offset method (like dateutil) instead of `(MONTHSBACK*30)` to avoid day misalignments.  
- If your original code is fine with approximate, that’s okay. But if you want truly “the last 2 calendar months,” do the monthly math approach.  
- This ensures your start and end boundaries line up with how Cost Explorer partitions monthly usage.
